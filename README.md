I have an experience of close to 2 years as a Technical Analyst for a utility project. I was trained on Java, Python and Databases but I had worked on middleware and databases during my professional experience. I am looking forward to work on Java again in this course and brush up my programming skills. 

I would like to learn more about advanced Java, C# and .net and make myself well versed with programming environment.
